# OpenSearch client compatibility

Most clients that work with Elasticsearch OSS 7.10.2 *should* work with OpenSearch, but the latest versions of those clients might include license or version checks that artificially break compatibility. This page includes recommendations around which versions of those clients to use for best compatibility with OpenSearch.

Client | Recommended version
:--- | :---
Java low-level REST client | 7.13.4
Java high-level REST client | 7.13.4
Python Elasticsearch client | 7.13.4
Elasticsearch Node.js client | 7.13.0

Clients exist for a wide variety of languages, so if you test a client and verify that it works, please [submit a PR](https://github.com/opensearch-project/documentation-website/pulls) and add it to this table.

## Python 3 test code

This code indexes a single document and is equivalent to `PUT /python-test-index1/_doc/1`.

```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

host = 'localhost'
port = 9200
# For testing only. Do not store credentials in code.
auth = ('admin', 'admin')

es = Elasticsearch(
  hosts = [{'host': host, 'port': port}],
  http_auth = auth,
  use_ssl = True,
  verify_certs = False
)

document = {
  "title": "Moneyball",
  "director": "Bennett Miller",
  "year": "2011"
}

response = es.index(index='python-test-index1', id='1', body=document, refresh=True)

print(response)
```


## Node.js test code

This code is equivalent to `GET /`.

```js
const { Client } = require('@elastic/elasticsearch')
const client = new Client({
  node: 'https://localhost:9200',
  auth: {
    // For testing only. Don't store credentials in code.
    username: 'admin',
    password: 'admin'
  },
  ssl: {
    // ca: fs.readFileSync('./cacert.pem'),
    rejectUnauthorized: false
  }
})

async function run () {
  const { body } = await client.info();
  console.log(body);
}

run().catch(console.log)
```
